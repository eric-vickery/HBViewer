# HBViewer
An iOS app that connects to a Hobby Boards Master Hub and displays the attached devices. This app was created back in 2013 when Hobby Boards was still in business. It has been updated to Swift 4 as an exercise but is no longer updated on the App Store

NOTE: The Hobby Boards Master Hub is a defunct product but the app can be used in demo mode to see the fucntionality.

The app has a mixture of Objective-C and Swift. It has some custom controls that are dynamically drawn. It uses AutoLayout and Size Classes to alter the layout dynamically for different devices and orientations.

The app has some deprecation warnings that need to be cleaned up but it still runs.
